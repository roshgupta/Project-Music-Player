# JAZZ MUSIC PLAYER PROJECT

This is a dummy music player website with zero functionality. It is just a front-end layout, coded just for practice shake.

Make sure to open it in Desktop only. Click here to open the site.. [JAZZ PLAYER](https://roshgupta.github.io/Project-Music-Player/)

Converting it in a backend project and adding some functionality of music player.
